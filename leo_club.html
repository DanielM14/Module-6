  <h3 align="center" >What is Leo CLub</h3>
  <p align="center">Leo Club is a club that volunteers to help the comminuty and it people.
    <br>
    This is also a good way to get to know new people and make friends.</p>
    <p align="center"><i>I was approached about getting a LEO club here at West about 7 to 8 years ago,
      <br>
      because I have always run a volunteer club. So the Davenport Breakfast Lions wanted to see who could help them run it.
      <br>
      There were 2 other teachers who are now not here that helped get it started.
      <br>
      The idea is that we just want to help people, so we help wherever we can!</i> - Ms.Hansen (Leo Club Leader)</p>
